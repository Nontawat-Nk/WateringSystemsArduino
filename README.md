# Arduino Project with DHT11, LDR, LCD Display, and Stepper Motor Control

This project integrates multiple components including a DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity, an LDR sensor, an LCD display, and stepper motors controlled via a TP6600 driver. The following sections explain the setup and functionality of each part of the code.

## Components Used
- Arduino Board
- DHT11 Sensor
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- LCD Display (I2C)
- Stepper Motors (with TP6600 Driver)
- LEDs
